# simple_shell
This project is part of the first year curriculum of Holberton School. Simple Shell is a command line interpreter that replicates the sh program on Linux. It can take in simple commands to navigate the terminal, manipulate files, and execute programs.

What we learned:

    How a shell works and finds commands
    Creating, forking and working with processes
    Executing a program from another program
    Handling dynamic memory allocation in a large program
    Pair programming and team work
    Building a test suite to check our own code
